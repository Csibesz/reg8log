============ in v2.0 (Dec 2013) ===============- several bugs fixed (some where security related but not critical).- now captcha is dynamically added to the login form when it is needed for the entered username; thus no need to refresh the page a second time only to add a captcha.- ajax captcha verification for all forms.- configurable autologin duration options in the login formseparate settings for admin and ordinary users (utmost flexibility!)see autologin_ages and admin_autologin_ages config vars in config_identify.php.- now can specify login upon register autologin duration.see the login_upon_register_age config var in config_register.php.- autologin (cookie) expiration time now is also checked on the server side which leads to more confidence and higher security since it can not be bypassed by a hacker or violated because of client side problems (like wrong client date/time)- now u can set a maximum duration for browser session autologins.this seems very good or even necessary for security.see the max_session_autologin_age config var in config_identify.php.===============================================
