added:- now captcha is dynamically added to the login form when it is needed for the entered username; thus no need to refresh the page a second time only to add a captcha.- ajax captcha verification for all forms.- configurable autologin duration options in the login formseparate settings for admin and ordinary users (utmost flexibility!)- can specify login upon register autologin duration- autologin (cookie) expiration time now is also checked on the server side which leads to more confidence and higher security since it can not be bypassed by a hacker or violated by client side problems (like wrong client date/time)
