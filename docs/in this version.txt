added:- now captcha is dynamically added to the login form when it is needed for the entered username; thus no need to refresh the page a second time only to add a captcha.fixed bugs:- depending on some values (0) of brute-force protection config vars, captcha was present in the login form while it shouldn't.- when change_autologin_key_upon_login config var was set to 2, that means changing autologin key on every request and thus setting a new autologin cookie on each request, and user has checked the 'remember me' check box, the cookie age was reset on every request after initial (manual) login, and thus in effect the cookie age became infinite.
